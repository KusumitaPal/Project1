Fashion E-Commerce Comapny Analysis 
(May 2024 - June 2024)

The aim of this project is to analyse sales data from a Fashion eCommerce business hosted on Shopify to get insights to drive strategies to boost sales by focusing on products and geographies showing a positive sales trend. 

I started by understanding the data which has many tables. Later, I decided on KPIs I will focus on and made a Power BI dashboard which has KPI cards, time series chart, bar charts representing categorical data, map and slicers to easily navigate through the dashboard. It gives a summary of the company perdormance to the client.

Other KPIs such as increase in sales, order and customers, customer retention etc. are calculated in Python Pandas in Jupyter notebook. I have done data manipulation and have got insights and arrived at three strategies to boost sales which are mentioned Fashion_Ecommerce_analysis document.
